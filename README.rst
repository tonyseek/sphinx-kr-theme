krTheme Sphinx Style
====================

This is the third-part package of Kenneth Reitz's krTheme_. You will not have
to copy the theme files into VCS or register it as submodule anymore.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install sphinx-kr-theme

Of course the general usage is putting that into your ``docs/requirements.txt``
then it will be found and installed by the build system such as ReadTheDocs_.

Usage
-----

In your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    import sphinx_kr_theme

    html_theme = 'kr'  # or 'kr_basic'
    html_theme_path = [sphinx_kr_theme.get_html_theme_path()]

In Sphinx >= 1.2, you only need to set the theme name:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme = 'kr_basic'
